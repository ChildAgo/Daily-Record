# SDIoT- a software defined based internet of things framework  
## 手记
1.Key Words  
- Internet of things (IoT)物联网  
- Software defined network (SDN)   
- Software defined systems (SDSys)  
- Software defined storage (SDStore)  
- Software defined security (SDSec)  
* forwarding elements转发单元  
- IBM 美国国际商用机器公司  
- interface protocols接口协议  
- Software defined perimeter (SDP)  
- WSN(Wireless Sensor Network)无线传感器网  
- API(Application Program Interface) 应用程序接口  
2.Main Ideas  
  
>In this paper,a software defined based framework for Internet
of Things (SDIoT) is proposed. At the first, we highlighted
how the software defined system handle the challenges of
traditional system architecture as it provides a centralized,
programmable, flexible, simple and scalable solution to con-
trol the systems. Then, different forms of SDSys (SDN,
SDStore, and SDSec) presented and explained, which are
considered the main known ones from the SDSys.  

>After discussing existing SDN, SDStore and SDSec
solutions, we talked about our proposed SDIoT architec-
tural model and showed how we exploit the ideas from
SDN, SDStore, and SDSec to build it. Later, we presented
its main elements and showed how these elements interact
with each other to provide a comprehensive framework to
control the IoT network.  

>The proposed model was built to provide a proof of
concept, and we explained how the systems can be built to
accommodate large data which produced from the wide-
spread of the IoT. We plan to develop an experimental
framework for SDIoT to test different forms and types of
the IoT topologies.  

- 基于软件定义的框架提出了SDIoT，然后提到了SDN、SDStore、SDSec，并用实例讲述了解决方案，最后提出如何构建适应大数据产生和蔓延的物联网框架。  


#A System Architecture for Software-Defined Industrial Internet of Things  
##手记  
1.Key Words  
- IIoT(Industrial Internet of Things)  
- IETF是Internet工程任务组（Internet Engineering Task Force）的简写  
- broad spectrum 广谱  
- QoS(quality of service)  
- FDs(field devices)现场设备  
- GW(gateways)网关  
- CORBA(Common Object Request Broker Architecture)通用对象请求代理体系结构  
- CoAP(constrained application protocol)  
- SC(sender cloud)  
- channel hopping 信道跳跃    
- time division 划分时间  
- bandwidth 带宽  
- (HPCC)是High Performance Computing and Communications(高性能计算与通信)的缩写  
- processing delay,queuing delay,transmission delay,propagation delay  
- 处理时延，排队时延，传输时延，传播时延  
- SD-IIoT system consists of IIoT FD,IIoT GW and IIoT SC

2.Main Ideas  
- In this paper, a new software-defined IIoT (SD-IIoT)
architecture with its key components based on the low-power
industrial WSNs will be proposed and the software-defined
functions for FDs, GWs, and SC based on WebSocket, CoAP,
and SDN technologies will be discussed.  
- I can not figure section3 and section4 out clearly.  
- An SD-IIoT architecture is proposed to
address the essential requirements of generic IIoT applications,
which can lead to an effective IIoT system design.
