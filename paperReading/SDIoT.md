2.Main Ideas  
  
>In this paper,a software defined based framework for Internet
of Things (SDIoT) is proposed. At the first, we highlighted
how the software defined system handle the challenges of
traditional system architecture as it provides a centralized,
programmable, flexible, simple and scalable solution to con-
trol the systems. Then, different forms of SDSys (SDN,
SDStore, and SDSec) presented and explained, which are
considered the main known ones from the SDSys.  

>After discussing existing SDN, SDStore and SDSec
solutions, we talked about our proposed SDIoT architec-
tural model and showed how we exploit the ideas from
SDN, SDStore, and SDSec to build it. Later, we presented
its main elements and showed how these elements interact
with each other to provide a comprehensive framework to
control the IoT network.  

>The proposed model was built to provide a proof of
concept, and we explained how the systems can be built to
accommodate large data which produced from the wide-
spread of the IoT. We plan to develop an experimental
framework for SDIoT to test different forms and types of
the IoT topologies.  

- 基于软件定义的框架提出了SDIoT，然后提到了SDN、SDStore、SDSec，并用实例讲述了解决方案，最后提出如何构建适应大数据产生和蔓延的物联网框架。
